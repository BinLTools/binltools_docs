## Introduction
File Formatting Tool (FFT) is a Microsoft Word add-in designed to improve efficiency, consistency, and accuracy when formatting documents for health authority submissions.

This section describes the one-time deployment process required to install FFT on a local machine and required two steps: Installing a trusted certificate on the local machine, and Sideloading the add-in manifest into Microsoft Word.

The deployment process is required only once per device. After deployment, users may proceed directly to the FFT User Guide for daily use.
